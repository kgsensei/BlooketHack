#### Known bugs:

- Failure to show correct answer with duplicate text-based questions.
  - Cannot use this cheat on sets like "Flags of the World".
- Colorama dependency install issue on Linux.
  - This is a Colorama issue, I don't think I can help. :(
- Chrome-driver fails to start.
  - This could be caused by a system administrator blocking unknown executable files/applications from running, in which case I highly recommend using glixzzy's cheat instead. Though it may require some JS console experience. [Link Here](https://github.com/glixzzy/blooket-hack).
